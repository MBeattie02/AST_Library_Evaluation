# AST_Library_Evaluation

This repository is used for testing and evaluation of two Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) libraries considered for implementation in the tool: Eclipse JDT Core and Java Parser. The tests carried out focus on two key aspects: speed and accuracy.




## Overview

This repository holds tests designed to assess the performance and reliability of the Eclipse JDT Core and Java Parser libraries. The aim is to provide a comparison between these libraries to identify their strengths and weaknesses in processing Java code to guide the decision on which library to integrate into our tool.

## Objectives

- Speed Test: Measure and compare the execution time taken by each library to parse and manipulate Java code. This includes the time taken to generate ASTs from source code and perform typical AST operations(print all method names in the class).

- Accuracy Test: Evaluate the precision with which each library parses Java code and generates its corresponding AST. This involves assessing the libraries' ability to correctly interpret various Java constructs
